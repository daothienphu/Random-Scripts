#Payday 2  
##Context:  
Payday 2 is a game I played from 2015 - 2017. Recently (2022) I found out there exists a page with almost every in-game image resources called [PAYDAY 2: FBI Files](https://fbi.paydaythegame.com/).  
This script is made to download all the in-game masks from that page, the (soon to be made) categories are referenced from the official game fandom [PAYDAY Wiki | Masks](https://payday.fandom.com/wiki/Masks_(Payday_2)#Trivia).  
##Script:  
####Dependencies:  
Python 3  
####How to run:  
Run the script with `python download_masks.py`.  
There will be categories selection in the future.
